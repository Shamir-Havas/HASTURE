# 🏥 HASTURE – Intelligent Hospital Management System

> A Data Science & Machine Learning Project integrating **GRU-based forecasting** and **HUOMIL pattern mining** to optimize hospital operations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
**HASTURE** is an intelligent **Hospital Management System (HMS)** built with **Django, GRU deep learning, and HUOMIL pattern mining**.  

It addresses critical hospital challenges:  
- 🏷️ **Automating operations**: Patient admission, ward allocation, inventory management  
- 📊 **Forecasting inventory**: GRU-based time series model for 12-month predictions  
- 🧮 **Pattern mining**: HUOMIL algorithm to identify high-utility & high-occupancy medical supplies  
- 📈 **Dashboards**: Role-based dashboards for doctors, in-charges, inventory managers, and administrators  
- 🔒 **Security**: Role-based authentication & access control  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Frameworks**: Django, MySQL  
- **Machine Learning**: GRU (Time Series Forecasting), HUOMIL (Pattern Mining)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Excel (openpyxl), GitHub  

---

## 📊 Key Features
- **GRU Forecasting** – Predicts 12-month demand for hospital inventory with MSE ≈ 9.74  
- **HUOMIL Algorithm** – Mines high-utility, frequently used medicines (e.g., Paracetamol, Amoxicillin, Insulin)  
- **Dashboards** – Real-time ward occupancy, patient trends, and inventory usage  
- **Role-based Access** – Secure, tailored dashboards for Admin, Doctor, In-Charge, and Inventory Manager
